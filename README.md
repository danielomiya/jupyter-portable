# Jupyter portable

A container to easily run Jupyter notebooks in a Anaconda3 environment.

## How to use it

Just run these scripts in order. :)

    $ scripts/start
    $ scripts/get-url

The last one will output URL information to access the Jupyter interface.

## Accessing container

There is a util script to access TTY.

    $ scripts/tty

That's all, folks! :p
